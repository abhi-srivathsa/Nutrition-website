					<h2 class="testimonial-full-headline">My lifestyle changed!</h2>
					<p>My name is Suhas, I'm from Bangalore. When I first started my journey of weight loss, I was not confident whether I would lose weight or not. I weighed 140kgs. I had been trying for many years to lose weight but every morning I would go on a diet and in the evening end up breaking it.</p>
					<p>Later when I had lost all hopes, I thought of giving it one last try. When I first started, my first target was to lose 2kgs in a week, and a week later when I weighed myself I had lost 4kgs in a very miraculous way. At that moment my confidence boosted up to the sky. From then on I never looked back.</p>
					<p>I have continuously been losing weight in a very healthy way without any anabolic or catabolic steroids or supplements. And I have successfully lost 30kgs of weight. I am very thankful to Mrs. Usha Harish for her weight loss diet programs. Now I am very much confident that I can maintain my physique with the right diet and proper workout.</p>

					<p>I would like to thank you for helping me reduce my weight. My lifestyle being unplanned, irregular eating habits, post pregnancy &mdash; all together led to overweight. I strictly followed your diet plan of eating lots of fiber in the form of vegetables and fruits.</p>
					<p>From you, I have realized that one cannot lose weight overnight and requires a lot of patience, discipline and dedication. With continuous encouragement and the support from my husband, I was helped through the journey of losing weight. The weight loss also brought the positive side of myself.</p>

					<h2 class="testimonial-full-headline">I lost weight and also feel very healthy...</h2>
					<p>You and my friends were a source of inspiration for the weight loss program. You particularly made the impossible possible. I had accepted my obesity as something which I have to live with but everything changed after consulting you.</p>
					<p>I strictly followed your diet plan of eating lots of fiber in the form of vegetables and fruits. The myth that diet means starving was proved wrong. Every two hours I was eating as per your instructions. This is when I realized that it is not eating but EATING RIGHT along with an hour's workout is the secret behind a healthy weight loss.</p>
					<p>Within a span of five and half months I lost about 21 kgs and I realized that nothing is impossible if you are determined to achieve it. I have not only lost weight but now I can walk a long distance without feeling tired, my legs don't swell up, and most importantly my severe thyroid problem is now normal. My sincere thanks to Mrs. Usha Harish.</p>

					<p>I had cholesterol problems, and my sugar was in the border line. In spite of playing badminton for 3 days and walking for 3 days, I was not able to reduce weight. Then I took one consultation and was impressed by the way Mrs. Usha was giving the consultation.</p>
					<p>I took the package for 3 months and followed her instructions. Now I have reduced about 10 kgs, my lipids have come down, and sugar level has come down. I am feeling very light. This result I gained without any crash diet, with only permutation and combination of the food I was having. Thank you very much!</p>

					<p>I took the 3 months healthy diet course and I found it is very helpful. My experience was wonderful. Also it helped me to manage my diabetes. I started with my HbA1c at 7.4 and when I completed the course it came down to 5.7.</p>
					<p>If we follow what Dr. Usha advises then I am sure we can achieve what we want. Doctor explains in detail and weekly consultation will be for status review of the previous week. At the end of the course she also explains how we have to maintain this going forward. I really thank Dr. Usha Harish for helping me learn about a healthy lifestyle.</p>

					<p>I had consulted Dr. Usha once before as well and had lost 12 kg in 3 months. This time, 3 months postpartum, I was stuck at the same weight even though I was eating right and exercising. Probably because of the hormonal changes.</p>
					<p>So I decided to consult again and I am glad to say I have lost 11 kg. The diet and exercise helped me gain strength and it did not affect my baby in the least. She made sure that I was eating enough and covered all the nutrients required for both me and baby. I was reducing weight and my baby was gaining as expected. I highly recommend her.</p>
